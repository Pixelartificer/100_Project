            <h1>SUN</h1>
            <p> The Sun is a vast, luminous ball of plasma that lies at the center of our solar system. It's a star classified as a G-type main-sequence star, often called a yellow dwarf. With an age of approximately 4.6 billion years, the Sun has been a constant source of light, warmth, and energy for our planet, supporting life and driving ecosystems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item02">
            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p> Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the Sun. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet—that title belongs to Venus due to its thick, heat-trapping atmosphere. Mercury is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a surface covered in craters, much like our Moon. Its gray, barren landscape is a result of billions of years of impact from asteroids and comets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item03">
            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p> Venus is the second planet from the Sun and often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. However, the similarities end there. Venus is a world of extremes, known for its scorching temperatures, thick atmosphere, and hostile conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item04">
            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It is a vibrant, dynamic world, often called the "Blue Planet" because of its vast oceans that cover about 71% of its surface. Earth has a perfect balance of conditions, including a stable climate, liquid water, and a protective atmosphere, all of which make life possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item05">
            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p> Mars, often called the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun and a fascinating world known for its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is a cold, rocky, and desert-like planet, with a thin atmosphere primarily made of carbon dioxide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item06">
            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a colossal gas giant with a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers—11 times that of Earth. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, much like a star. Its immense size and mass (more than twice that of all the other planets combined) give it a powerful gravitational pull.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item07">
            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p> Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a gas giant renowned for its stunning ring system, the most elaborate and visible of any planet in the solar system. It has a diameter of about 120,536 kilometers, making it the second-largest planet after Jupiter. Saturn is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface, though it may have a dense core of metal and rock.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item08">
            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and one of the most unique worlds in our solar system. It is an ice giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements like water, ammonia, and methane. Methane in its atmosphere gives Uranus its pale blue-green color by absorbing red light from the Sun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item09">
            <h1>Neptune</h1>
           <p> Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is an ice giant, similar to Uranus, composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and a significant amount of "ices" like water, ammonia, and methane. Methane in its atmosphere gives Neptune its striking deep blue color, which is even more vibrant than Uranus's.</p>
